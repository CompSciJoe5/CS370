Pirate Intelligent Agent – Reflection

For this project, I implemented a deep reinforcement learning model to simulate an intelligent pirate agent navigating a maze to reach a treasure. The maze environment was predefined as an 8x8 grid of free and blocked cells. I was provided with key components: the environment setup (TreasureMaze.py), the experience replay system (GameExperience.py), and a Jupyter Notebook scaffold. My primary responsibility was completing the deep Q-learning algorithm within the notebook. This involved writing the qtrain() function to train the model using episodes, rewards, and backpropagation through a neural network.

Throughout the course, I learned foundational principles in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks. This project specifically allowed me to apply those concepts in a real-world simulation. As a computer scientist, my role involves designing efficient, logical, and scalable solutions to complex problems. This work requires not only technical skills but also critical thinking, patience, and a solid understanding of how algorithms interact with data and environments.

My approach to solving problems as a computer scientist has matured. I’ve learned to break down large challenges into smaller tasks, experiment through iteration, and analyze system behavior to refine solutions. By testing different parameters such as learning rates, exploration factors, and memory sizes, I was able to improve the agent’s performance and achieve a 100% win rate.

Ethically, I recognize the responsibility I have to build systems that serve users fairly and transparently. Intelligent systems must be trained responsibly, avoiding bias, and prioritizing user safety. In any real-world implementation, it’s critical to communicate model limitations and ensure the outcomes do not harm individuals or mislead organizations.

This project has reinforced both my technical skills and my understanding of the ethical and human-centered responsibilities in developing AI systems.
